# O'Reilly Software Architecture Kata Entries

Finalist entries to the O'Reilly Software Architecture Katas give us excellent examples of how to approach architecting software. No two are the same, despite following the same original brief. **How could you use these examples in your own work?**

> If you have an O'Reilly account (paid or free trial) you can access more information on their [Architectural Katas page](https://learning.oreilly.com/featured/architectural-katas/).

I created the [KataLog](https://github.com/TheKataLog) to preserve the entries to the O'Reilly katas. Please [head over to the KataLog](https://github.com/TheKataLog) to see all the semi-finalists and entries for all past O'Reilly katas.
